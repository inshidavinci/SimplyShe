## Inspiration
In 2022, the number of missing persons under the age of 21 was alarmingly high, with 206,371 females reported missing compared to 64,956 females over 21. These staggering statistics highlight a pressing need for solutions that empower young women to feel safe in their everyday lives. The stories of young women feeling unsafe while simply walking home or meeting friends needs to be addressed. Gender equality includes creating environments where everyone can thrive without fear. SimplyShe aims to be part of that change, we want to ensure that every woman can navigate her daily routine with confidence.

## What it does
Once you open SimplyShe, you might think it’s just a diary or music player, but surprise! It’s a cleverly disguised emergency app designed to keep you safe. 

### Key Features:
- **Instant Alert System**: At the touch of a button, you can send an alert to your emergency contacts, letting them know you need help. You can customize your alert message to convey the situation accurately, ensuring that your friends or family know exactly what’s happening.

- **Safety Word**: One unique feature is the “Safety Word” function. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't directly call for help, you can send a predefined word or phrase that instantly notifies your contacts of your need for assistance without raising suspicion. 

- **Situation Playlist**: SimplyShe includes a calming playlist designed to help you feel more relaxed in stressful situations. But the songs mean more than just calming you down. Adding different songs to your playlist give emergency contacts more information about your current situation. For example, if you added the song "Whispers of Steel" it symbolizes there are weapons in the scene or if you added "Silent Scream" to the playlist it symbolizes you are scared but can not speak of it out load. This smart playlist gives emergency useful information to be prepared when coming for the rescue!

- **Live Location Tracking**: With the live location tracking feature, your trusted contacts can see your real-time location when you feel unsafe. You can share your location with them temporarily or until you reach your destination, ensuring you’re never alone when you need support.

- **Daily Journaling**: Beyond safety, SimplyShe offers a journaling feature that allows you to express your thoughts and feelings. This helps you maintain your mental well-being while also serving as a record of your daily experiences. You can write about anything from your day-to-day encounters to your safety concerns, making it a holistic tool for empowerment.

The app is incredibly easy to access and use—simply tap the designated safety icon, and your trusted contacts receive real-time updates about your safety status. SimplyShe doesn’t just keep you connected; it empowers you with essential information and tools to navigate a world that often feels unpredictable. Whether you’re walking home at night or meeting friends, SimplyShe is your discreet companion, helping you feel secure every step of the way.

## How we built it
We leveraged multiple APIs to create a seamless experience for our users. Using Leaflet for interactive maps and GeoLocation APIs for precise location tracking, our code integrates these powerful tools to ensure accuracy and reliability. The end result is an app that not only looks great but functions flawlessly, providing users with a dependable safety companion.

## Challenges we ran into
Finding the right APIs posed a significant challenge. We searched for solutions that would fit our needs without the high costs or excessive download requirements. The journey included evaluating numerous APIs for functionalities like SMS alerts and real-time tracking. Through persistence and creative problem-solving, we navigated these obstacles, ultimately crafting an app that fulfills our vision while providing safety features.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are incredibly proud of what we’ve achieved with SimplyShe. This project marks our first experience coding a fully functional app from the ground up. We successfully integrated complex APIs and created a user-friendly interface that truly enhances safety. We’ve grown as developers and have gained valuable skills and experiences that have empowered us along the way!

## What we learned
Throughout this project, we learned not only about coding and API integration but also about the importance of teamwork and perseverance. We gained insight into user experience design and the critical nature of safety applications in today’s world. Each challenge taught us to think creatively and adapt quickly, enhancing our problem-solving abilities. We emerged from this project not just as better coders but as more informed advocates for safety and empowerment.

## What's next for SimplyShe
Looking ahead, we are excited about the potential for SimplyShe. Future updates will focus on adding customizable alerts, enhanced user features, and even more robust integration with emergency services. We envision creating a community around our app, where users can share their stories and suggestions for improvements. Together, we can make SimplyShe an essential tool for empowerment and safety, paving the way for a future where every woman feels secure in her daily life.
